# 2D-Heat-Conduction-OpenCL  
Implementing heat conduction simulation in OpenCL, for CUDA&amp;OpenCL project  
Compile program with attached makefile, call it using './heat_sim ?' to see command flags  
Attached MATLAB script allows for generating .gifs visualising simulation, however it is recommended to modify initialisation function for this (matrix_lib.c and matrix_lib.h), as well as diffusivity
